# Xylophone App

A Flutter project I made while learning Flutter Development.

About the App: 
- Includes a splash screen with logo, title and a 'made by' line.
- Imported and used the AudioPlayer external package to facilitate Xylophone musical notes
- Designed a very basic UI for the Xylophone keys.
